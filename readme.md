# fdshell

A new shell for FreeDOS. Code will contain usable utilities 
borrowed from Unix and maintain full compatibility with MSDOS 6.22
`command.com`.

## Why?
Because

## License
GPL V3. See file license.txt

## Building

The assumption is that this project will be developed on
Linux (or any Posix compliant OS), and we maintain compatibilty
with DOS at all times. The reason, is for better tooling (git, 
valgrind, strace, text-editors).

Code is strictly C (asm where needed). Code should compile using
ia16 (https://github.com/tkchia/gcc-ia16), and with some luck Turbo C version 2.01
(http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20841) Pacific C could be a good bonus (http://www.grifo.com/SOFT/Pacific/uk_pacific.html). 

Ideas and inspiration do come from busybox (the applet concept for
example). However - this project does not share any code, and cannot
be considered a derived work (please don't copy code from Busybox here,
as I might re-license it).

Check out this git repository:

    git clone [todo]
    ./configure
    make

`configure` is a smart shell script which can automatically generate stubs
for internal applets. If you need to add a new applet, just:
    
    touch unix/vi.c
    ./configure
    Generating header for unix/vi.c
    Generating content for unix/vi.c
    make

A new stub will be generated, containing code you can continue hack on. `main.c`
is autogenerated, contianing your new applet. `main.c` should not be modified, 
since is completelly auto generated.
